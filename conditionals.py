# we dont always want to check if every if statement equates to true 
# mostly only one statement will be true 
# elif makes our code more efficiant
# will only run if no other conditional was evaluated as true

# weight converter app: convert a user inputted weight(float),

# write an if statement that checks if the unit is Kgs or Lbs
# and print the converted value. If Kgs print out in Lbs. 
# else: to handle the other conversion. 
# Error handling for upper/lower case input.
